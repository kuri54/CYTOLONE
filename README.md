## ✨ Overview
**CYTOLONE** (Cytology All-in-One) is a real-time AI-powered support tool for **cytotechnologists in cervical cytology**.  
Unlike conventional AI systems that require **whole slide imaging (WSI)**, CYTOLONE operates **without WSI**, enabling **low-cost and high-speed AI support** using just an iPhone and an Apple Silicon Mac.

Key Features:
- **Real-time support**: Provides results in less than 0.5 seconds
- **WSI-free, low-cost operation**: No expensive scanners or GPUs required
- **High-accuracy classification using hierarchical labeling**: Covers Anomaly, Malignancy, Bethesda, and Diagnosis categories
- **Optional LLM-based findings generation**

For more details, see the published paper:  
[🔗 Whole Slide Imaging-Free Supporting Tool for Cytotechnologists in Cervical Cytology (Modern Pathology 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.modpat.2025.100817)

## 💡 Usage
- This library is optimized **only** for Apple Silicon Macs and iPhones.
- It does **not support Windows or other operating systems**, and other camera devices are untested.

### 💻 Setup
0. **Preparation**
    - Prepare an Apple Silicon Mac and iPhone, and log in with the **same Apple ID**.  
    - Connect your Mac and iPhone using a **USB-C cable** (**or Thunderbolt cable**) .  
    📝 Note:  
      > Bluetooth is supported, but **a wired connection is recommended for  better stability**.  
    - Connect your iPhone to the microscope using an adapter.

1. **Install Python**

    📢 Important:  
    > macOS comes with Python pre-installed, but the version is outdated and cannot install the latest libraries required by this app.  
    > Please install **Python 3.12**.

    <br>

    ```bash
    brew install python@3.12
    ```

    **For [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) users:**
    ```bash
    uv python install 3.12
    ```

2. **Installation**:
    - Clone this repository.
     
    - Move into the cloned directory:
      ```bash
      cd CYTOLONE
      ```

    📝 Note:
    > **For uv users:**
    This section is unnecessary. Install dependencies with `uv sync`, then proceed to step 3.

    <br>

    - Create and activate a virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python3.12 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

      📝 Note:  
      > Perform all subsequent steps **within this virtual environment**  

    <br>

    - Install required libraries: 
      ```bash
      pip install -e .
      ```



3. **App Settings**
    - Default settings:
      ```
      LANGUAGE = en --------------- App language setting (en or ja)
      MODEL = v1.1 ---------------- Model version to use (choose v1.0 or v1.1)
      LLM_GEN = False ------------- Enable or disable LLM-based findings generation
      LLM_GEN_THRESHOLD = 0.8 ----- Threshold for enabling LLM output
      WEBCAM_IMAGE_SIZE = 1024 ---- Webcam input image size
      ```

    - How to change settings
      - Display all settings: 
        ```bash
        cytolone-config --list
        ```

      - Set the app language to Japanese: 
        ```bash
        cytolone-config --LANGUAGE ja
        ```

      - Reset to default settings:
        ```bash
        cytolone-config --reset
        ```

        ⚠️ Warning:  
        Enable `LLM_GEN` **only if your Mac has at least 64GB of unified memory**.  
        Insufficient memory **may cause system crashes**.

    - `WEBCAM_IMAGE_SIZE`  
       📢 Important:  
       > `WEBCAM_IMAGE_SIZE` is the **most critical setting** in this app.  
       > Please check [this guide](/CYTOLONE/scale_check/README.md) for details.  

    <br>

    - Download the models
      ```bash
      download-model
      ```
      - Required models will be downloaded automatically.  
      - If `LLM_GEN` is set to `False`, **language models will not be downloaded**.  
        To use LLM features, change the setting to `True` and run the command again.  

      ⚠️ Warning:  
      > `download-model` **requires an internet connection**.  
      > For offline environments, temporarily connect to the internet or manually download the models on another PC and place them in the specified directories.

      Download links:

      Place the models in the following directories:  
      ```
      CYTOLONE/mlx-models/kuri54/mlx-CYTOLONE-v1/  
      CYTOLONE/mlx-models/mlx-community/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B-Japanese-8bit/

## 🔭 Planned Features
The following features are planned for future updates:

- **Region-of-Interest Highlighting with Red Circles**  
  Users will be able to place a red circle on any part of the image to prompt the model to focus on that specific area during evaluation.  
  _Reference_: [What does CLIP know about a red circle? Visual prompt engineering for VLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06712)

- **Screening Mode**  
  When enabled, this mode will continuously evaluate the "Anomaly" category in real time during microscopic observation.
